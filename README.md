To start using this project follow this step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   
   You'll need Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
   
   To check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
   
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   
   You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm.

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You'll need to install react and Material UI.
   To do so open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   npm install 
   ```

3. **Clone repo from GitHub**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IvanCvitan/my-app
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   
   Change your working directory to the project:
   
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server**:
   
   To run React app locally and see the changes in real-time, you can start the development server. In your project directory, run:
   
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
   This will start the development server, and the app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. As you make changes to your code, the development server will automatically reload the app.

6. **Testing the App**:
   
   You can test the app by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the React app running. 

That's it!
